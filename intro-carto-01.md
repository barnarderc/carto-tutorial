# Introduction to Mapping with Carto 

####Workshop Objectives 
This exercise is intended to introduce users to mapping and displaying spatial information using the online platform, Carto. 

[Carto](https://carto.com) is an online platform that allows users to upload data in a few different formats, and provides tools to visualize that data. Maps made on Carto can be shared and embeded. 

In this first introductory tutorial users will:

1. Create a Carto account
1. Become familiar with Carto's dataset and map views
1. Learn how to upload simple datasets to their Carto account
1. Learn basic interface and visualization tools available


Subsequent workshops demonstrate how to execute simple data manipulations in Carto, as well as add interactive elements, customize basemaps, and embed and share maps.

####Creating a Carto Account

To begin using Carto, users must first create an online account [here](https://carto.com/signup). Carto's basic account is free, and allows users to upload a limited number of files. 

Once you've created your account, and verified your email, when you sign into Carto you will be presented with the option to begin by creating a new map.

# Introduction to Mapping with Carto 

This exercise is intended to introduce users to mapping and displaying spatial information using the online platform, Carto. 

Carto is an online platform that allows users to upload data in a few different formats, and provides tools to visualize that data. Maps made on Carto can be shared and embeded. 

In this first introductory tutorial users will:

1. Create a Carto account
1. Become familiar with Carto's dataset and map views
1. Learn how to upload simple datasets to their Carto account
1. Learn basic interface and visualization tools available

Subsequent workshops demonstrate how to execute simple data manipulations in Carto, as well as add interactive elements, customize basemaps, and embed and share maps.

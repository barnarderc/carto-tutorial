# Introduction to Mapping with Carto 

####Workshop Objectives 
This exercise is intended to introduce users to mapping and displaying spatial information using the online platform, Carto. 

[Carto](https://carto.com) is an online platform that allows users to upload data and provides tools to visualize that data in interactive maps. Maps made on Carto can be shared and embeded on websites and in different formats. 

In this first introductory tutorial users will:

1. Create a Carto account
1. Become familiar with Carto's dataset and map views
1. Learn how to upload simple datasets in tabular and vector formats to their Carto account
1. Learn basics of interface and visualization tools 


Subsequent tutorial pages demonstrate how to execute simple data manipulations in Carto, as well as add interactive elements, customize basemaps, and embed and share maps.

The data used in this workshop can be found in the data folder of this repository [(here)](https://github.com/barnarderc/carto-tutorial/tree/master/data).

####Creating a Carto Account

To begin using Carto, users must first create an online account [here](https://carto.com/signup). Carto's basic account is free, and allows users to upload a limited number of files. 

Once you've created your account, and verified your email, when you sign into Carto you will be presented with the option to begin by creating a new map.
